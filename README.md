# My vimrc configuration!

This is a (very) basic vim configuration having some frequently required options set and useful plugins enabled. It uses the following:
* [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs)

To use this configuration:

Install git and curl if not already installed!

Then run:

`git clone https://github.com/skrtbhtngr/vimrc.git ~/.vimconf`

`chmod +x ~/.vimconf/install.sh`

`~/.vimconf/install.sh`

This script installs `vim-pathogen`, `vim-airline`, and `auto-pairs`.

Highlighting the cursor line may cause color issues as I have set the colors according to solarized-dark color scheme of terminal (not vim).
